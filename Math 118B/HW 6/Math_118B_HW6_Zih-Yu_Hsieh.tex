    \begin{question}
        Rudin Chapter 5 Exercise 22:

        Suppose $f$ is a real function on $\mathbb{R}$. Call $x$ a \textit{fixed point} of $f$ if $f(x)=x$.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[(a)] If $f$ is differentiable and $f'(t)\neq 1$ for every real $t$, prove that $f$ has at most one fixed point.
            \item[(b)] Show that the function $f$ defined by 
            $$f(t)=t+(1+e^t)^{-1}$$
            has no fixed point, although $0<f'(t)<1$ for all real $t$.
            \item[(c)] However, if there is a constant $A<1$ such that $|f'(t)|\leq A$ for all real $t$, prove that a fixed point $x$ of $f$ exists,
            and that $x=\lim x_n$, where $x_1$ is an arbitrary real number and
            $$x_{n+1}=f(x_n)$$
            for $n=1,2,3,....$
        \end{itemize}
    \end{question}
\end{myBox}

\textbf{Pf:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] Given $f$ is differentiable and $f'(t)\neq 1$ for all real $t$. Suppose the contrary that $f$ has more than one fixed point,
    there exists distinct $x,y\in\mathbb{R}$ (and WLOG, assume $x<y$), with $f(x)=x$ and $f(y)=y$. However, by Mean Value Theorem, there exists $c\in (x,y)$, such that $f'(c)=\frac{f(y)-f(x)}{y-x}=\frac{y-x}{y-x}=1$,
    which contradicts the assumption that all $t\in\mathbb{R}$ satisfies $f'(t)\neq 1$.

    Hence, the assumption is wrong, $f$ couldn't have more than one fixed point.

    \hfil

    \item[(b)] Given $f(t)=t+(1+e^t)^{-1}$, apply the differentiation rules, we get:
    $$f'(t)=1-(1+e^t)^{-1}\cdot e^t = 1-\frac{e^t}{(1+e^t)^2}$$
    Since for all $t\in\mathbb{R}$, $e^t>0$, so $(1+e^t)>1$ and $(1+e^t)>e^t$. Hence, $0<\frac{e^t}{(1+e^t)^2}<1$ (since everything is positive, while $e^t<(1+e^t)<(1+e^t)^2$).

    Yet, there doesn't exists a fixed point: If consider $f(t)-t$, we get $(1+e^t)^{-1}$. Since $e^t>0$ for all $t\in\mathbb{R}$, then $(1+e^t)>0$, so does $(1+e^t)^{-1}$. Therefore, there doesn't exists $t\in\mathbb{R}$, 
    with $(1+e^t)^{-1} = f(t)-t=0$, so there doesn't exist any fixed point for this function.

    \hfil

    \item[(c)] Suppose there exists $0\leq A<1$ such that $|f'(t)|\leq A$ for all real $t$. Then, for al distinct $x,y\in\mathbb{R}$ (WLOG, assume $x<y$), by Mean Value Theorem,
    there exists $c\in (x,y)$, with $f'(c)(x-y)=(f(x)-f(y))$. So, the following is true:
    $$|f(x)-f(y)| = |f'(c)|\cdot |x-y|\leq A|x-y|$$

    \hfil

    Now, for any $x_1\in\mathbb{R}$, we'll prove by induction that all $n\in\mathbb{N}$, $|x_{n+1}-x_n|\leq A^{n-1}|x_2-x_1|$.

    For base case $n=1$, it's clear that $|x_{1+1}-x_1| = |x_2-x_1| \leq A^{1-1}|x_2-x_1|$.

    Now, suppose for given $n\in\mathbb{N}$, $|x_{n+1}-x_n|\leq A^{n-1}|x_2-x_1|$, then for case $(n+1)$:
    $$|x_{(n+1)+1}-x_{n+1}| = |f(x_{n+1})-f(x_n)| \leq A|x_{n+1}-x_n| \leq A\cdot A^{n-1}|x_2-x_1| = A^{(n+1)-1}|x_2-x_1|$$
    Which, this completes the induction, showing that all $n\in\mathbb{N}$ satisfies $|x_{n+1}-x_n|\leq A^{n-1}|x_2-x_1|$.

    \hfil

    Now, we can prove that the sequence $(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\mathbb{R}$, therefore converges:

    Given that $0\leq A<1$, then $\frac{1}{1-A}>0$. Now, since $A^{n-1}|x_2-x_1|$ defines a geometric sequence with ratio $0\leq A<1$,
    then $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}A^{n-1}|x_2-x_1|=0$. So, for all $\epsilon>0$, since $\frac{1-A}{|x_2-x_1|}\epsilon>0$, there exists $N$,
    with $n\geq N$ implies $A^{n-1}|x_2-x_1|<(1-A)\epsilon$.

    Now, for all $m>n\geq N$, the following is true:
    $$|x_m-x_n| = \left|\sum_{k=0}^{m-n-1}(x_{n+(k+1)}-x_{n+k})\right| \leq \sum_{k=0}^{m-n-1}|x_{n+(i+1)}-x_{n+i}|$$
    $$|x_m-x_n|\leq \sum_{k=0}^{m-n-1}|x_{n+(i+1)}-x_{n+i}| \leq \sum_{k=0}^{m-n-1}A^{n+k-1}|x_2-x_1|$$
    $$|x_m-x_n|\leq A^{n-1}|x_2-x_1|\sum_{k=0}^{m-n-1}A^{k} \leq A^{n-1}|x_2-x_1|\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}A^k$$
    $$|x_m-x_n|\leq A^{n-1}|x_2-x_1|\cdot\frac{1}{1-A} < (1-A)\epsilon \cdot \frac{1}{1-A} = \epsilon$$
    Since for all $\epsilon>0$, there exists $N$, with $m>n\geq N$ implies $|x_m-x_n|<\epsilon$, hence $(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is a cauchy sequence,
    which converges to some $x\in \mathbb{R}$.

    Then, since $f$ is differentiable, then $f$ is continuous; hence, the following is true:
    $$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}f(x_n)=f\left(\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}x_n\right)=f(x),\quad \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}f(x_n)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}x_{n+1}=x$$
    Hence, $f(x)=x$, which any $x_1\in\mathbb{R}$ with $x_{n+1}=f(x_n)$, has the sequential limit being a fixed point $x\in\mathbb{R}$.

    Also, based on the previous part, since all $t\in\mathbb{R}$ has $|f'(t)|\leq A<1$, then by part (a), since $f'(t)\neq 1$ for all $t$, $f$ has at most one fixed point.
    Hence, this fixed point is unique, all such sequence $(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ converges to a unique fixed point $x\in\mathbb{R}$.

    \begin{question}
        For $f(x) = \cos(x)$, show that $x_{n+1}=f(x_n)$ defines a convergent sequence
        for arbitrary $x_0\in\mathbb{R}$. Calculate the root $\alpha=\cos(\alpha)$, with an error less than
        $10^{-2}$.
    \end{question}
\end{myBox}

\textbf{Pf:}

For all $x_0\in\mathbb{R}$, since $|x_1|=|cos(x_0)|\leq 1$, then WLOG, we just need to consider the properties of $\cos(x)$ on the domain $[-1,1]$.

For all distinct $x,y\in[-1,1]$ (WLOG, assume $x<y$), since $\cos(x)$ is differentiable on $\mathbb{R}$ (with derivative $-\sin(x)$), by Mean Value Theorem, 
there exists $c\in (x,y)$, such that $(\cos(x)-\cos(y))=-\sin(c)(x-y)$. Also, notice on $[-1,1]$, $|\sin(x)|$ has a maximum at $1$ 
(since $\sin(x)$ is strictly increasing on this domain, hence $-\sin(1)=\sin(-1)\leq \sin(x)\leq \sin(1) < 1$; so $|\sin(x)|\leq \sin(1)$ on $[-1,1]$). Hence:
$$|\cos(x)-\cos(y)|=|-\sin(c)|\cdot|x-y| \leq \sin(1)\cdot|x-y|$$
Using similar
 from \textbf{Question 1}, with the above inequality, since $x_1=\cos(x_0)\in[-1,1]$ and $\sin(1)<1$, 
then all $n\in\mathbb{N}$ satisfies $|x_{n+1}-x_n|\leq \sin(1)^{n-1}\cdot |x_2-x_1|$.

\section*{6}
\begin{myBox}[]{}
    \begin{question}
        Let $K\subset \mathbb{R}^n$
        be a compact set and $f : K \rightarrow K$ be a function such that
        $$\|f(x)-f(y)\|=\|x-y\|,\quad \forall x,y\in K$$
        Show that $f$ is a bijection.
    \end{question}
\end{myBox}

\textbf{Pf:}

\textbf{$f$ is Injective:}

For all $x,y\in K$, suppose $f(x)=f(y)$, then since $0=\|f(x)-f(y)\|=\|x-y\|$, then $x=y$ is enforced. Hence, this proves injectivity.

\hfil

\textbf{$f$ is Surjective:}

Suppose the contrary, that $f$ is not surjective (so, $f(K)\subsetneq K$).

First, since for all $\epsilon>0$, choose $\delta=\epsilon$, all $x,y\in K$ with $\|x-y\|<\delta=\epsilon$ satisfies $\|f(x)-f(y)\|=\|x-y\|<\epsilon$,
hence $f$ is uniformly continuous on $K$. Then, because $K$ is compact, then $f(K)$ is also compact, which is closed and bounded.

Now, since $K\setminus f(K)\neq \emptyset$ based on assumption, there exists $x_0\in K\setminus f(K)$. Which, because the sets $\{x_0\}$ and $f(K)$ are both compact (which are both closed),
while the two sets are disjoint, then by \textbf{HW 1 Question 3} (part from \textbf{Rudin Chapter 4 Question 21}), in any metric space,
disjoint closed set $C$ and compact set $K$ always have $\inf\{d(x,y)\ |\ x\in C,y\in K\}>0$ (a positive distance between sets $C$ and $K$).
So, apply this to the two sets, there exists $\lambda>0$, such that all $y\in f(K)$ satisfies $\|x_0-y\| = d(x_0,y) \geq \lambda$.

\hfil

Then, define $f_0(x)=x$, $f_1(x)=f(x)$, and for all integer $n\geq 1$, $f_{n+1}(x)=f(f_n(x))$. 
(Note: inductively, we can also prove that all $m,n\in\mathbb{N}$ satisfies $f_m(f_n(x))=f_{m+n}(x) = f_n(f_m(x))$).

With this definition, we can prove by induction that for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$,
all $y\in f_{n}(K)$ satisfies $\|f_n(x_0)-f(y)\|\geq \lambda$.

For base case $n=1$, recall that for all $y\in f_1(K) = f(K)$, because all $y\in f(K)$ satisfies $\|x_0-y\|\geq \lambda$, since $f$ preserves distance, we have:
$$\|f_1(x_0)-f(y)\| =\|f(x_0)-f(y)\| = \|x_0-y\| \geq \lambda$$
Hence, all $y\in f_1(K)$ satisfies $\|f_1(x_0)-f(y)\|\geq \lambda$, the claim is true for $n=1$.

Now, suppose for given $n\in\mathbb{N}$, all $y\in f_{n}(K)$ satisfies $\|f_n(x_0)-f(y)\|\geq \lambda$.
Then, for all $y\in f_{n+1}(K) = f(f_n(K))$, there exists $x\in f_n(K)$, with $f(x)=y$. Which, by induction hypothesis, $\|f_n(x_0)-y\|=\|f_n(x_0)-f(x)\| \geq \lambda$. 
Hence, the following inequality is true:
$$\|f_{n+1}(x_0)-f(y)\| = \|f(f_n(x_0))-f(y)\| = \|f_n(x_0)-y\| \geq \lambda$$
Which, all $y\in f_{n+1}(K)$ satisfies $\|f_{n+1}(x_0)-f(y)\|\geq \lambda$, completing the induction.

\hfil

Lastly, consider the sequence defined recursively as $x_n=f_n(x_0)$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$. Then, since $f$ restrict the element to still be in $K$, then $(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\subset K$, a compact set (which is closed and bounded).
Hence, by Bolzano Weierstrass Theorem, since $(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is bounded, there exists a convergent subsequence $(x_{n_k})_{k\in\mathbb{N}}$, which this subsequence is Cauchy.

Then, given $\lambda>0$, there exists $N\in\mathbb{N}$, such that all $p\geq N$ implies $\|x_{n_p}-x_{n_{p+1}}\| < \lambda$, by the definition of Cauchy Sequence.

However, since $n_{p+1}=n_p+k$ for some $k\in\mathbb{N}$, looking back at the definition, $x_{n_p}=f_{n_p}(x_0)$, while $x_{n_{p+1}}=x_{n_p+k}=f_{n_p+k}(x_0) = f_k(f_{n_p}(x_0))$.

Because $k\geq 1$, then $f_k(x) = f(f_{k-1}(x))$, so $x_{n_{p+1}}=f_k(f_{n_p}(x_0))=f(f_{k-1}(f_{n_p}(x_0))) = f(f_{n_p}(f_{k-1}(x_0)))$.

So, let $y=f_{n_p}(f_{k-1}(x_0))\in f_{n_p}(K)$, by the previous claim, the following inequality is true:
$$\|x_{n_p}-x_{n_{p+1}}\| = \|f_{n_p}(x_0)-f(f_{n_p}(f_{k-1}(x_0)))\| = \|f_{n_p}(x_0)-f(y)\| \geq \lambda$$
Yet, this contradicts the statement that $\|x_{n_p}-x_{n_{p+1}}\| < \lambda$.

\hfil

Since we eventually reach a contradiction, then the assumption must be false, so $f$ needs to be surjective.

\hfil

The above two sections proved that $f$ is in fact a bijection.
