\begin{question}
    Let $f : (a, b) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be differentiable on $(a, b)$.
    
    Prove : if $\forall x\in(a,b),\ f'(x)\neq 0$, then $f$ is one-to-one on $(a, b)$.
    
    Give an example showing that the converse statement is in general not true.
\end{question}

\textbf{Pf:}

Suppose $\forall x\in(a,b),\ f'(x)\neq 0$:

\hfill

\textbf{(1) $f'(x)$ is strictly less than or greater than $0$ on $(a,b)$:}

We'll prove by contradiction: Suppose $f'(x)$ is neither strictly less than $0$ nor strictly greater than $0$ on $(a,b)$,
then there exists $x_0, x_1\in (a,b)$, with $f'(x_0)\leq 0$ and $f'(x_1)\geq 0$, and by the assumption that $f'(x)\neq 0$,
the strict inequality $f'(x_0)< 0$ and $f'(x_1)> 0$ is applied. (This also implies $x_0 \neq x_1$, since derivatives are different
 at the two points).

\hfill

Recall that for function $f:[a,b]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be differentiable on $(a,b)$, if $a<c<d<b$ and 
$f'(c)\neq f'(d)$, for any $\lambda$ strictly in between $f'(c)$ and $f'(d)$ (either $f'(c)<\lambda<f'(d)$ or $f'(c)>\lambda>f'(d)$),
there exists $x\in (c,d)$ with $f'(x)=\lambda$.

Then, first suppose $x_0<x_1$: $f$ is differentiable on $(a,b)$ and $f'(x_0) < 0 < f'(x_1)$ implies there exists $x\in(x_0,x_1)$ with
$f'(x)=0$, which contradicts the assumption;

then suppose $x_1<x_0$: again, $f$ is differentiable on $(a,b)$ and $f'(x_1)>0>f'(x_0)$ implies there exists $x\in (x_1,x_0)$ with
$f'(x)=0$, which again contradicts the assumption.

So, the assumption is false, $f'(x)$ must be strictly greater than $0$ or less than $0$ for all $x\in (a,b)$.

\hfill

\textbf{(2) $f$ is strictly increasing or decreasing on $(a,b)$:}

Based on \textbf{(1)}, $f'(x)$ is strictly less than $0$ or strictly greater than $0$.

Suppose $f'(x)>0$ for all $x\in(a,b)$, then for any $x,y\in (a,b)$ with $x<y$, by the Mean Value Theorem, 
there exists $c\in (x,y)\subseteq (a,b)$, such that the following is true:
$$\frac{f(y)-f(x)}{y-x}=f'(c) >0,\quad (f(y)-f(x))=f'(c)(y-x)$$
Since $(y-x), f'(c)>0$ by assumption, the $(f(y)-f(x))=f'(c)(y-x)>0$, thus $f(y)>f(x)$, showing that $f$ is strictly increasing.

Similarly, suppose $f'(x)<0$ for all $x\in (a,b)$, with the same $x,y$ above, by Mean Value Theorem, there exists $c\in(x,y)\subseteq (a,b)$,
such that the following is true:
$$\frac{f(y)-f(x)}{y-x}=f'(c) <0,\quad (f(y)-f(x))=f'(c)(y-x)$$
Since $(y-x)>0$ and $f'(c)<0$, then $(f(y)-f(x))=f'(c)(y-x)<0$, of $f(y)<f(x)$, showing that $f$ is strictly decreasing.

\hfill

With the above condition, since $f$ is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing on $[a,b]$, 
then for all $x,y\in(a,b)$, $x\neq y$ implies $f(x)\neq f(y)$ (or else it's no longer strictly increasing or decreasing).
Thus, $f$ is in fact one-to-one on $(a,b)$.

\hfill

\textbf{Counterexample of Converse:}

Let $f:[-1,1]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be $f(x)=x^3$, which $f'(x)=3x^2$, which $f'(0)=0$. 
Yet, suppose $x,y\in (-1,1)$ has $x^3=y^3$, then:
$$x^3-y^3=(x-y)(x^2+xy+y^2)=0$$
Which, the only real solution is $x=y$ (since if treating $y$ as constant, $y^2-4y^2=-3y^2\leq 0$; the only time with real solution is when $y=0$, which implies $x^3=0$, or $x=0$).

So, $f(x)=x^3$ is one-to-one on the region $(-1,1)$, but still has $f'(0)=0$, which is a counterexample.

\section*{2}
\begin{question}
    Let $f : (a, b) \rightarrow R$ be a function such that:
    $$\exists M,\exists\alpha,\ \forall x,y\in(a,b),\ |f(x)-f(y)|<M|x-y|^\alpha$$
    If $\alpha\in(0,1)$, then $f$ is Holder of order $\alpha$ in $(a, b)$. If $\alpha$ = 1, then $f$ is Lipschitz.
    Prove :

    (a) If $\alpha>1$, then $f$ is constant.

    (b) If $\alpha\in(0,1]$, then $f$ is uniformly continuous on $(a, b)$.

    (c) Give an example such that $f$ is Lipschitz, but not differentiable.

    (d) If $f$ is differentiable on $(a, b)$ and $f(x)$ is bounded on (a, b), then f is Lipschitz.
\end{question}

\textbf{Pf:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] Suppose $\alpha>1$, then there exists $\epsilon>0$, such that $\alpha=1+\epsilon$. Which, for all $x,y\in (a,b)$ (with $x\neq y$), the following is true:
    $$|f(x)-f(y)|<M|x-y|^\alpha = M|x-y|^{1+\epsilon} = M|x-y|\cdot|x-y|^{\epsilon}$$
    $$\left|\frac{f(x)-f(y)}{x-y}\right| = \frac{|f(x)-f(y)|}{|x-y|}<M|x-y|^\epsilon$$
    Which, fix arbitrary $x_0\in (a,b)$, for all $y\in(a,b)$ with $y\neq x_0$, the following is true:
    $$0\leq \left|\frac{f(x_0)-f(y)}{x_0-y}\right|<M|x_0-y|^\epsilon,\quad -M|x_0-y|^\epsilon<\frac{f(x_0)-f(y)}{x_0-y}<M|x_0-y|^\epsilon$$
    Since $\epsilon>0$, then $\lim_{y\rightarrow x_0}|x_0-y|^\epsilon=0$. Which, by Squeeze Theorem, the following is true:
    $$0=\lim_{y\rightarrow x_0}-M|x_0-y|^\epsilon\leq \lim_{y\rightarrow x_0}\frac{f(x_0)-f(y)}{x_0-y} \leq \lim_{y\rightarrow x_0}M|x_0-y|^\epsilon = 0$$
    Thus, $\lim_{y\rightarrow x_0}\frac{f(x_0)-f(y)}{x_0-y}=0$, or $f'(x_0)=0$.

    \hfill

    This implies that $f(x)$ is a constant function: Suppose $f(x)$ is not a constant function, then there exists $c,d\in (a,b)$ with $c<d$, such that $f(c)\neq f(d)$.

    Notice that since $f'(x_0)$ exists for all $x_0\in(a,b)$, then by Mean Value Theorem, there exists $x\in (c,d)$, such that $f'(x)(d-c)=f(d)-f(c)$.

    Yet, since $f'(x)=0$, while $f(d)-f(c)\neq 0$, $0 = f'(x)(d-c)\neq f(d)-f(c)$, which it is a contradiction.

    Thus, $f(x)$ must be a constant function.

    \hfill
    
    \item[(b)] Suppose $\alpha\in (0,1]$, notice that for all $x,y\in(a,b)$, the following is true:
    $$a<x<b,\quad -b<-y<-a,\quad (a-b)=-(b-a)<(x-y)<(b-a),\quad |x-y|<|b-a|$$
    Thus, $|x-y|^\alpha
    \item[(c)]
    \item[(d)]
